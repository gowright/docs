## üéØ Learning Objectives

After completing these getting started examples, you will understand:

1. **Framework Initialization**: How to properly initialize and configure the Gowright framework
2. **Configuration Management**: Different approaches to managing configuration across environments
3. **Test Structure**: How to structure your first test with proper setup and teardown
4. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling patterns and recovery mechanisms
5. **Resource Management**: Understanding framework resource usage and cleanup

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23.0+ installed
- Basic understanding of Go testing patterns
- Chrome/Chromium browser for UI testing examples

### Running Your First Example

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gowright/framework
   cd framework
   ```

2. **Run all getting started examples:**
   ```bash
   # Run all examples with enhanced reporting
   ./examples/run_all_examples.sh
   
   # Or run just the getting-started category
   ./examples/run_category.sh getting-started
   ```

3. **Run individual examples:**
   ```bash
   # Basic usage example
   go run examples/getting-started/basic_usage.go
   
   # Configuration example
   go run examples/getting-started/configuration_examples.go
   
   # Your first test
   go run examples/getting-started/first_test.go
   ```

## üìã Common Configuration Patterns

### Default Configuration
```go
framework := gowright.NewWithDefaults()
defer framework.Close()
```

### Custom Configuration
```go
config := &gowright.Config{
    LogLevel: "info",
    Parallel: true,
    MaxRetries: 3,
}
framework := gowright.New(config)
defer framework.Close()
```

### Environment-Based Configuration
```go
config, err := gowright.LoadConfigFromFile("config-" + os.Getenv("ENV") + ".json")
if err != nil {
    config = gowright.DefaultConfig()
}
framework := gowright.New(config)
defer framework.Close()
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Framework initialization fails:**
- Ensure Go 1.23.0+ is installed
- Check that required dependencies are available
- Verify Chrome/Chromium is installed for UI testing

**Configuration file not found:**
- Check file path is relative to working directory
- Ensure JSON syntax is valid
- Verify file permissions

**Resource cleanup warnings:**
- Always use `defer framework.Close()`
- Check for goroutine leaks in custom code
- Monitor resource usage during development
